{"name":"Samaritan","tagline":"Samaritan is intended to be a Intelligent Video Surveillance System which has various techniques inherited from Computer Vision and Machine Learning.","body":"## Objective\r\nIn this project we intend to design and implement an Intelligent Video Surveillance system which consists of an embedded system and PC-based system. We will be designing a PC-based intelligent system that detects motion and depending on a threshold value for movement and activates alerts(Sound/Email) in presence of motion. Samaritan is implemented on an embedded system consisting of an ARM processor(Raspberry Pi) which has sufficient amount of RAM(~512MB).\r\n\r\n![samaritan](http://postimg.org/image/3w004g96b/)\r\n\r\n## Hardware\r\n* Raspberry Pi Model B\r\n* 8GB SD Card\r\n* USB WiFi Adapter for Raspberry Pi\r\n* USB Camera/Pi camera module\r\n* PC or Laptop\r\n* Stepper Motor (Optional)\r\n* Motor Driver (Optional)\r\n* Router (Optional)\r\n\r\n## Documentation & Management\r\nPlease refer this [documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_a2ETiW7kaRMk1uNHFja0prM2c) & [project management](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_a2ETiW7kaRa3JGQWt0TzgwYTA)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
